It is\r\nin no way affiliated with GitHub.com\r\n\r\nHow it works\r\n------------\r\n\r\nSet the email address in your git config to something @hubuser.com. For the sake\r\nof uniqueness I'd recommend using your GitHub username. So mine would be\r\nnuclearsandwich@hubuser.com\r\n\r\n    git config --global user.email nuclearsandwich@hubuser.com\r\n\r\nNow add this email address to the list of emails attached to your account on\r\nGitHub.com and just don't verify it.\r\n\r\nCaveats and Addendums\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nYou can't use this email for GitHub Pages since pages only build for verified\r\nemail addresses.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer\r\n----------\r\n\r\nAgain, this has no affiliation with GitHub and is just here to save people who\r\nare paranoid about spam. I doubt I will ever set up an MX record for this\r\ndomain but if I do it will be because Big Brother told me to and all it will\r\nhave is an admin@hubuser.com that forwards to my proper email address.\r\n\r\n\r\nLove and kittens,\r\nSteven! aka @nuclearsandwich\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
