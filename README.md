HubUser.com
===========

This domain is only here to let people put email addresses of valid form in
their GitHub commits without fear of spammers harvesting email addresses. It is
in no way affiliated with GitHub.com

How it works
------------

Set the email address in your git config to something @hubuser.com. For the sake
of uniqueness I'd recommend using your GitHub username. So mine would be
nuclearsandwich@hubuser.com

    git config --global user.email nuclearsandwich@hubuser.com

Now add this email address to the list of emails attached to your account on
GitHub.com and just don't verify it.

Caveats and Addendums
---------------------

You can't use this email for GitHub Pages since pages only build for verified
email addresses.

Disclaimer
----------

Again, this has no affiliation with GitHub and is just here to save people who
are paranoid about spam. I doubt I will ever set up an MX record for this
domain but if I do it will be because Big Brother told me to and all it will
have is an admin@hubuser.com that forwards to my proper email address.


Love and kittens,
